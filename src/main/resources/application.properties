aaejo.jds.openai.client.prompt-instructions=The following text was scraped from a Philosophy Faculty member's profile at a University. You will return their full name, email, and philosophy specializations formatted like a Java array like this: ['first and last name', 'email', ['Specialization1', 'Specialization2' etc]]. It's likely that the text may not contain 1 or perhaps all of the fields (name, email, specializations) in which case you will put NULL for that field or return --ERROR-- if none of the 3 fields are present. Note that the philosophy specializations should be generic and widely known. Use as few specializations as possible. Also note that the email field must contain a valid email (or null if there is no email in the profile text). Here is the raw text scraped from this faculty member's profile:
